wp_handle_upload_prefilter

Description

When you upload Media from your WordPress admin dashboard,
wp_handle_upload is called once for each file the user specified.
wp_handle_upload_prefilter is an admin filter that is called by the
wp_handle_upload function. The single parameter, $file, represents a
single element of the $_FILES array. The wp_handle_upload_prefilter
provides you with an opportunity to examine or alter the filename
before the file is moved to its final location.

Examples
add_filter( 'wp_handle_upload_prefilter', 'custom_upload_filter' );

function custom_upload_filter( $file ){
	$file['name'] = 'wordpress-is-awesome-' . $file['name'];
	return $file;
}

Using this, in conjunction with the upload_dir, you can dynamically
determine which directory to upload to, based on the files you upload.

Languages: English • 中文(简体) • (Add your language)

Description
This hook allows you to change the directory where files are uploaded to.
The keys and values in the array are used by the wp_upload_dir function
in wordpress core, which is doing the work.

Examples
This goes into your plugin.

add_filter('upload_dir', 'awesome_wallpaper_dir');

function awesome_wallpaper_dir( $param ){

	$mydir = '/awesome';

	$param['path'] = $param['path'] . $mydir;
	$param['url'] = $param['url'] . $mydir;

	error_log("path={$param['path']}");
	error_log("url={$param['url']}");
	error_log("subdir={$param['subdir']}");
	error_log("basedir={$param['basedir']}");
	error_log("baseurl={$param['baseurl']}");
	error_log("error={$param['error']}");

	return $param;
}

If your plugin is written as a class, you'll want to hook to it like so:

add_filter('upload_dir', array(&$this,'awesome_wallpaper_dir'));

Using this, in conjunction with the wp_handle_upload_prefilter,
you can dynamically determine which directory to upload to, based on the files you upload.
