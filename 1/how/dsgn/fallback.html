<h1>Principles of Design</h1>

<p>The principles of design could be said to be roughly similar in any field. That is, a specification needs to be written up using words. Then a diagram or set of diagrams needs to be made. Then prototypes, and finally the final version. If designed well, it is entirely possible that the item designed lasts for a long time with little modification. That is the goal here.</p>

<h2>Types of Design</h2>

<p>The types of objects that can be designed could fall into a few different categories. The first would be that of a solid, physical 3D object. As the capabilities to produce images on a screen that <em>resemble</em> solid, physical, 3D objects, the tendency is to rely on this, rather than the object constructed out of a solid, physical 3D material of some sort. If depending on the object to perform an action in the 3D world, it is essential (of course) that the object exist in 3D. Otherwise it won't be able to perform an action. The tendency to rely on computers is advanced to such a degree, that this needs to be spelled out. This wouldn't have to be done thirty years ago, before the widespread use of computers and reliance on them.</p>

<p>The second type of design could be a diagram or computer code. The difficulty in conveying the potential complexity of computer code is that so few people have a working knowledge of it. It is vague, far away and difficult to grasp. So much of it is available free of charge to them, that one may get an impression that it really isn't worth very much. However, that impression quickly changes when actually working with it and wanting to change it to get it to do what one wants. Then it can be seen that it requires a high degree of skill to write code that works well and performs as intended.</p>

<p>The third type of design could be that of a story. When one writes a novel, fiction or non-fiction, that story requires a certain layout. To achieve this, the author needs to spend time with the outline of the book and how it is going to turn out. If done well, the book will have an internal consistency that it may not have otherwise.</p>

<p>The fourth type of design could be that of thought and habit. That is, the way that one thinks and has a habit of thinking has an influence on the daily behaviour of that person. For example, if I have decided that the best way to carry out a project is to follow a method, then that method will help determine what I do next. This is in contrast to a results-oriented approach. A results oriented approach would focus on the end goal, but not as much on the steps needed to get there. These are different.</p>

<h2>Historical Inertia</h2>

<p>It is possible that a platform or brand becomes so popular that the platform or brand replaces the underlying mechanics as a way of doing things. A few popular brands have to do with search and social media. Because of their ease of use and popularity, these brands and platforms are used, in favour of the underlying mechanics used separately. When the majority of people are no longer familiar with and able to use the underlying mechanics, then they lose the capability to perform these functions on their own. While this may not be an issue most of the time, there may be times when it becomes important to be able to function without the aid of ubiquitous platforms.</p>

<p>For example, the author is intimately acquainted with WordPress. He has looked through the source code from time to time, out of curiousity and when having questions about how it works. He has written a complete set of plugins for it, as well as a few themes. He has optimized the hilt out of it, so that it loads in under a second. And yet, still there had been something missing.</p>

<p>That "something" was the fact that WordPress keeps changning in unknown ways, or ways that are time consuming to track. These changes are made by unknown volunteers (although they are not unknowable). And these changes are made on a complex set of code that keeps increasing in size. Further, the default is that the core updates automatically, or expects periodic updates, as do the plugins and themes. When this happens, there is a chance that the site breaks. Not fun.</p>

<h2>Untangling a Spider's Web</h2>

<p>After an awful lot of time (more time than the author cares to admit), a way was found to deal with this uncertain by employing a few basic principles and a few basic methods. These were that it was important to have a backup in case something went wrong. Then it was found that it was important to have a backup of the backup. Finally, it was realized that all that was really needed was a file that contained HTML that could be loaded as a fallback page. Really. In other words, it was <em>incredibly</em> difficult to simplify this tangled web of complexity. Not unlike trying to untangle a spider web. The gut reaction to just take a swing at the whole thing is essentially the result that was found here.</p>
