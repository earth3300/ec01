<h1>Groups</h1>

<p>Coming in at the tail end of this project, was both the realization that groups were important, and the ability to incorporate this idea--at the same time. That is, an inordinate amount of time was spent on the directory structure, default settings, constants, you name it, and through it all was this nagging realization (and inability) to find <em>just the right kind of group of people</em> in which to hash this all out and to share it with. On the one hand are the monolithic entities with which most are familiar. These are useful, to a degree and in the right context, but at the other end is the need to have the same kind of informal "space" and control over an idea that one might have in an office environment where one can hash ideas out, without even the thought that one is posting to the world, or on one of the monolithic sites.</p>

<p>This "in between" need was better visualized after spending a lot of time thinking about and working with the two dimensional layout of an actual community design. Thirty or forty years ago, one simply did not have the luxury of posting something online that the entire world could read. Life happened within the three or four square miles that one could bike or walk comfortably. Whomever your friends or neighbours were within that space, that was it. There were certain advantages to this, as these limits made one have to adjust to one's environment, not the other way around.</p>

<p>In a sense, the ability to post to everyone, everywhere can be a disadvantage. By doing so, the idea is diluted, and allowing anyone, anywhere to comment can result in the wrong kind of response being elicited. In contrast, by including in the workflow a much smaller step--that of posting to a community of known people--the responses from this known group of people could be that much more valuable.  Then, once the idea has stood the test of time (perhaps after a year or so), it could be posted openly, to the rest of the world. In this way (if the idea were posted to a known group of people living within a limited geographic area)--and there was no response--one could simply ask one or two people if they actually saw the post and what they thought of it. Perhaps they simply didn't see it or were too busy.</p>

<p>In contrast, if one posts to the world, then who is one going to ask for a response, if no one responds. Or say someone does, but you have no idea who they are? That type of reponse isn't going to be very helpful, and it may be somewhat damaging, especially if their response is negative, despite the fact that it may be an acceptable idea. So, there are a number of reasons why it may be appropriate to think about including community based thinking in one's workflow, even if one does not live in a community that is set up to provide that kind of feedback, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Looking at the same thing from the other way around, the trend has been, in my experience, to simply post something (usually a blog post, but sometimes a video) to the world, simply because that is the default configuration. There <em>is</em> no internal group to post to, simply because there isn't one automatically set up. This is where the work in setting up an integrated package can help. Part of setting up an integrated package involved finding the right kind of plugins and then including them, making sure there were no conflicts with the other plugins or the theme. Another part of this is to adjust the settings of the plugin, and then to adjust any other settings, as needed. With the membership plugin added, there were a few more general settings that had to be adjusted.  This is aided by the fact that a "settings" plugin was available that could handle these changes and then incorporate them into the standard configuration.</p>

<h2>It's All About the Default</h2>

<p>One of the shifts in mindsets that has happened as the internet has proliferated throughout the world and into people's lives is that there is <em>so</em> much information available and in such a specific manner, that if one site isn't <em>exactly right</em>, a few more clicks may very well bring one to a site that is. That is, if one is setting up a package (or an integrated package, in this case), then care needs to be taken to help ensure that its right from the start. The expectation that is set from the front page, needs to be met all the way through. This can take a lot of work. However, if this work is done--and the setup allows one to set up the right kind of default easily--then the user experience should be quite pleasant.</p>
