<p>The intent of this page is to create a static page that does not move. This
is different from most other web pages. Most other web pages have at least a
menu and a footer, and perhaps a sidebar. This page does not have those. Yet
it is created using exactly the same technologies as these other types of pages.
The only thing that is different is the type of thinking that is used to create
the page and the intent for which it is created.</p>
